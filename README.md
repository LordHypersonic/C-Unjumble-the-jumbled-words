Hello peeps! Lord Hypersonic greets you. Today I am here with  a c++ program that will solve any jumble word. ONLY WORD. 
For working of this program you need words.txt text file in the same folder, in which EXE file is. 
So the working of program is like this; 

1. First it will ask for jumbled word.
2. Then it will convert the lower case alpha to upper case alpha, then sort the string, means if you
     give: "ollhe" then after sorting it will look like this: "EHLLO"
3. Then it will open the text file (words.txt) which contain all English words (download link is given above). 
4. Then it will copy the words from file to string line (line by line). 
5. Then it will sort the line (convert the lower case alpha to upper case alpha, then sort the word), and check both the strings i.e, sorted jumbled words and sorted word from file. If both strings are equal then that word is the answer.
6. Then it will print all possible answers.

NOTE:  words.txt SHOULD BE IN SAME FOLDER IN WHICH THE EXE OF PROGRAM IS, OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT WORK.
